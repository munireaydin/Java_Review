OOP Principles:

    1. Encapsulation: hiding the data

                     to have complete control over the filed

    2. Inheritance: IS A relation (parent/child  or super/sub)

                    To Inherit the common variables and methods from one class

                    Easiest way to get rich

    3. Abstraction: hiding the implementation details

                Ignore the details, focus on essentials

                How it's done is not important

    4. Polymorphism: Ability of the objects to take on many forms

                    Use one reference variable to reference to multiple objects of different type
                            (parent type)                               (child)

                    Parent type decides what's accessible through the reference variable

Reference Type Castings:

        up-casting: casting smaller to larger type (implicitly done)

        down casting: casting larger to smaller type





without polymoprhism:

    chromeDriver

    firefoxDriver

    operaDriver

    safariDriver

    ....


with Polymorphism:

   WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
